"""Pick-and-place mode: locate a box, grab a ball, drop it in the box.

State machine:
  BOX_SEEK     — scan with empty gripper, looking for the box
  BOX_LOCKING  — visual servo until centered + at known radius over the box
  BOX_VERIFY   — drive to saved box pose and confirm the box is still there
  BALL_PHASE   — delegate to BallFollowMode for ball detect + grab
  TRANSPORT    — drive to saved box pose
  DROPPING     — open gripper
  HOMING       — return home
  DONE         — terminal (unused while auto-loop is enabled)

After every drop (and on startup when box_pose.json exists) the loop runs
BOX_VERIFY before the next ball cycle:
  - box at saved pose                 → BALL_PHASE
  - box visible but drifted in frame  → BOX_LOCKING (re-locks + re-saves pose)
  - box not visible from saved pose   → BOX_SEEK (full envelope scan)

Composition over inheritance: BallFollowMode is instantiated and run as-is
during BALL_PHASE — its `hold_target` going non-None is the signal that the
ball has been grabbed and we should advance to TRANSPORT.
