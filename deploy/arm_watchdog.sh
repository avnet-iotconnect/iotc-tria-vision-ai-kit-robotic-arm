# Boot + recovery supervisor for the robotic-arm pick-and-place demo.
#
# Launches the app in IDLE: the arm connects and IOTCONNECT + the camera stack
# come up, but the arm DOES NOT MOVE and no vision runs until an operator sends
# a start command from the cloud. This keeps the arm safe on the table at
# power-up and after any hiccup.
#
#   START movement:  set_mode  mode=yolo-pickplace     (from IOTCONNECT)
#   STOP  movement:  set_mode  mode=idle   (or: stop_demo)
#
# The supervisor also: relaunches (into idle) when the xArm re-enumerates after
# a USB drop, and relaunches (into idle) if the app dies while the arm is
# healthy. Both recoveries return to the SAFE idle state, not to moving.
#
# Pause the supervisor (e.g. to calibrate over SSH):  touch /tmp/demo_watchdog_off
# Resume:                                              rm /tmp/demo_watchdog_off
